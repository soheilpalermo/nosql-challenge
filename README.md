# NoSQL Challenge: UK Food Establishment Hygiene Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains my NoSQL project for the Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp. The project focuses on analysing hygiene levels and ratings of food establishments in the UK. Using MongoDB as the primary database, I performed data import, transformation, and analysis to gain insights into food safety and hygiene standards across various establishments.

### Tools and Technologies
- MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing and managing data.
- Python: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including libraries such as PyMongo for database interaction.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and running the analysis.

### Credits
All code and analysis were conducted by Soheil Dabooyeh as part of the Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp.
